## Kuure Dashboard
  
  Thanks again for giving me the opportunity to work on this! This should be a pretty straight-forward React app. 

  I used node-sass for the styling and the Victory visualization library for the data modelling. I chose to keep the Victory library in a class component as I figured that this would likely need to have access to state to update metrics were this to truly be up and running. 

  I have this project launched on gitHub pages with the link pasted into my repo. If you have any other questions I'd be happy to talk more with you all!
